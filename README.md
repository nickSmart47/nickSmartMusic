# Interval Trainer


Web app to aid music teachers in teaching Aural Skills. Currently includes only an Interval Trainer app.

Technologies: React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

In the long term, plan to build this app into a larger portfolio site to showcase various music teaching applications and my own musical compositions, as well as information regarding bookings for solo piano performances.
